## 🚀 About Me

With a background in biotechnology and scientific reporting, my goal is to bridge scientific rigor and analytical creativity — using data to explain why things happen and predict what happens next.

I’ve built and analyzed models across industries — from customer churn and insurance claims to content engagement and agricultural yield. I’m driven by curiosity, structure, and the impact data can make when translated into real-world decisions.

## 📌 Featured Projects

🔹 [Recipe Site Traffic Prediction (Machine Learning + KPI)](#)  
> Classified high-traffic recipes using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
> Defined a business KPI — High Traffic Conversion Rate (HTCR) — to align model precision with strategy.
→ Best Model: Logistic Regression (Precision = 0.88, HTCR = 7.13)

🔹 [Telecom Customer Churn Analysis](#)  
> Predictive model to identify customers at risk of churn using billing and usage patterns.  
> _→ F1 Score: 0.85 | Key tools: Python, Random Forest, Seaborn_

🔹 [Insurance Claim Outcome Modeling](#)  
> Built classifiers to predict insurance claims and explored risk segmentation.  
> _→ Accuracy > 75% | SMOTE for class balancing_

🔹 [Netflix Content Trends](#)  
> EDA and visualization of global trends across genres, ratings, and durations.  
> _→ Clear dashboards to support content strategy decisions_

🔹 [Penguin Clustering (PCA + K-Means)](#)  
> Unsupervised learning project to classify species based on biometric traits.

🔹 [Crop Yield Prediction (Regression)](#)
