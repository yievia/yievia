## 🚀 About Me

With a background in biotechnology and scientific reporting, my goal is to bridge scientific rigor and analytical creativity — using data to explain why things happen and predict what happens next.

I’ve built and analyzed models across industries — from customer churn and insurance claims to content engagement and agricultural yield. I’m driven by curiosity, structure, and the impact data can make when translated into real-world decisions.
